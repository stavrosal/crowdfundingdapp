# Crowdfunding DApp (Sepolia Network)

A React-based decentralized crowdfunding application (DApp) that interacts with an Ethereum smart contract deployed on the [Sepolia test network](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x997dc6f0B39c128bD0e40f46DC79CD045052e7A2). The DApp allows users to view, contribute to, and manage crowdfunding campaigns directly through their web browser using a connected Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask).

You can see the live version of the application [here](https://stavrosal.github.io/crowdfundingdapp/)


## Features
- **View Campaigns:** Display active crowdfunding campaigns.

- **Contribute to Campaigns:** Users can make contributions to the campaigns by sending Ether.

- Get **refunded** from cancelled/banned campaigns.

**Note:** This repository contains only the static version of the application. If you would like access to the source code, please contact [me](mailto:stavrosgramer@gmail.com) for more information.
